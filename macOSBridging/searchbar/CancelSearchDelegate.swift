/// There appears to be a bug with NSSearchFieldCell's cancel button as of macOS 13.x.
/// Clicking the cancel button in the search bar does not consistently trigger the search bar text changed event
/// We are creating this protocol to ensure when cancel button is clicked, we manually fire the text changed event with empty text
protocol CancelSearchDelegate: AnyObject {
    /// triggered when user clicks the clear button on search box
    func didClickCancel()
